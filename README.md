# Nice_Price_or_No_Dice
Shoppers often look to the holiday season for the best prices for consumer goods, particularly electronics. Shoppers are usually willing to spend money on products that they want to have and also enjoy the discount that comes with it.

I’d love to build a tool to let people use it to find out when is the best buying time. I’ll use machine learning as my tool to build that.For single customers, they can use this as a tool before shopping and save money and the time to find a  better deal. In the future, I want to take this as an extension on browsers, so shoppers can use this tool before they go online shopping and save them money instantly.
